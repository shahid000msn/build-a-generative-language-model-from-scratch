You’ve heard about AI and its applications. You’ve probably used AI—maybe without even realizing it. Now, take a deep dive into AI in this hands-on course by building your own AI from scratch. Instructor Ronnie Sheer first guides you through a short project: the creation of a text completion model similar to the autocomplete function on a smartphone. He then shows you how to build a model that filters out hateful comments on social media. Plus, Ronnie demonstrates how you can use lyrics from your favorite songs to generate new, thematically similar lyrics.
